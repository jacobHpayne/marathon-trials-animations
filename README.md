A tool for visualizing runners to manage lap traffic

Runners begin on a six or eight mile circuit, and then run the appropriate number of laps (4 or 3 respecticely)
before finishing on a 2.2 mile straigh away.

100 pixels = 1 mile

1 frame = 10 seconds (arbitrary, but used to scale speed and wave delay)
